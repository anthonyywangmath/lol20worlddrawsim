        <p>This is a simulator for the League of Legends group draw.</p>
        <section>
        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <p>We assume that the final drawing is subject to the following restriction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For any four teams in the play-in stage, it is possible to add these four teams to the four groups so
                that each group does not have two teams from the same region.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This restriction is equivalent to the following two restrictions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For each (3-team) group, no two teams are from the same region.</li>
            <li>TSM (Pool 1 LCS 1st seed), DRX (Pool 2 LCK 2nd seed) and MCX (Pool 3 PCS 1st seed) do not form a group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            One can check the equivalence by using a computer program to list out the possibilites.
            Alternatively, one can prove this as follows:
        </p>
        <p><a class="expand-hide">Expand proof</a></p>
        <aside id="proof-text">
        <p>
            First, note that the most restrictive scenario is that LGD (LPL 4th seed), MAD (LEC 4th seed), TL (LCS 3rd seed) and PSG (PCS 2nd seed)
            make it out of play-ins as all other regions with teams in play-ins only send one team, so any configuration which works for these four teams
            will still work after replacing any of these teams by a different play-in team.
            Thus, the first condition holds if and only if it holds when 
                LPL4, LEC4, LCS3 and PCS2 make it out of play-ins.
        </p>

        <p>
            If LCS1, LCK2, PCS1 form a group and
                each (3-team) group does not have two teams from the same region, 
                then each of the other groups must have one team from LPL and one team from LEC.
            This would mean that both LPL4 and LEC4 cannot go in any other group, and must be placed in this one.
            But there is only one opening.
            Therefore, it is not possible to add both LPL4 and LEC4 if LCS1, LCK2, PCS1 form a group.
            We see that the original restriction implies the two new restrictions.
        </p>

        <p>
        On the other hand, suppose that each (3-team) group does not have two teams from the same region.
        Then LCS1, LCK2, PCS1 is the only possible group which does not contain any LPL or LEC team.
        Indeed, such a group contains exactly one team from LCK, LCS and PCS.
        It must have PCS1 from pool 3.
        Moreover, LCK2 is the only team in pool 2 which is not in the LPL or LEC.
        The final team must be from pool 1 and in the LCS, so it must be LCS1.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thus, if each (3-team) group does not have two teams from the same region, and TSM, DRX, MCX do not form a group,
            then it is possible to add the two teams LPL4 and LEC4 to two of the groups.
        Since there are three LCK teams, at least one of the two remaining groups has a team from the LCK.
        This group will then have one team from the LPL, one team from the LEC and one team from the LCK.
        The last group will then have one team from LPL, one from LEC, and one from one of LCK, LCS or PCS.
        Whatever the case, it is possible to add one of LCS3 or PCS2 to this last group, and the remaining team to the previous group
            with the team from the LCK.
        </p>
        <p>
        We conclude that the the two new restrictions are equivalent to the original restriction.

        <h2>Assumptions on the Methodology</h2>
        <p>
        We assume that the method of producing the groups from the random draw is similar to 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zICp00yA8vE" title="Youtube Video of 2019 League of Legends Worlds Group Drawing show">
            that of the previous year</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Explicitly, the first four draws are from pool 1 and they are placed in group A, then group B, then group C, then group D.
        The next four draws are from pool 2.
        For each draw, the team is placed in the earliest group which does not result in an illegal set of groups.
        This process is repeated for pool 3.
        </p>

        One subtlety is that in 2019, the pools were such that one only needed to make sure that each (3-team) group did not have two teams
            from the same region, while this year, one also needs to make sure TSM, DRX and MCX do not form a group.
        This means that after pool 2 has been drawn, if one of the groups contains both TSM and DRX, then RGE must be placed into this group,
            as none of the other three teams in pool 3 are allowed with both TSM and DRX.
